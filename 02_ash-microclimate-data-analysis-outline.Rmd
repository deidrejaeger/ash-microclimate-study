## Analysis Plan

*Step 1:* Calculate the difference in temp between the treatments and controls for the study duration

*Step 2:* Run a paired t-test between the hourly averaged differences in temperature before ash removal and after 

*Step 3:* Make a barplot or boxplot to show the average difference and st error in temperature in the before and after treatments.
